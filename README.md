## 1 - Description

Practices carried out during the Computer Vision course.

## 2 - Labs

### 2.1 - Swap colors
Make Gamora blue and Nebula green without altering the background as much.

### 2.2 - Gamma correction and geometric transformations
* Use gamma correction to yellow the jet image.
* Use transforms to assemble a stickman with the circle and line image.

### 2.3 - Spatial, frequency, and convolutional filters
 * Apply space and frequency domain filters to images to remove noise.
 * Apply a kernel to a color image to make it gray.
 * Apply a kernel to an image to make it yellow.
 
### 2.5 - Match of descriptors
 * Apply SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB and
BRISK to generate a panoramic image.

### 2.6 - Seam Carving
 * Apply Seam Carving to a video to resize it.
 
### 2.7 HaarCascade
 * Apply HaarCascade on video to detect facial features.
